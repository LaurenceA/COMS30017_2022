# Computational Neuroscience

This is a 3rd year Computer Science unit. We will try to understand how the brain works from a computational point of view.

## Staff
- [Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/) (unit director)
- [Conor Houghton](https://conorhoughton.github.io)

## Weekly schedule
- Lectures (weeks 1-7)
  - 9am Tuesdays (FRY BLDG G.10 LT)
  - 3pm Thursdays (CHEM BLDG LT1)
- Problem classes (starting week 2, 5th Oct)
  - 10am-11am Wednesdays (MVB 1.11)

## Term schedule
- **Weeks 1-7**: Lectures
- **Weeks 2-**: Problem classes.  These will be held in MVB 1.11 with TAs + sometimes the lecturer.  Please bring any questions on problem sheets, past exams etc. to this session!  The idea is to ask TAs questions individually, this isn't a "big" QA session where everyone listens to everyone else's questions!
- **Weeks 8-10**: Coursework time, for those in CS taking the 20-credit coursework version of the unit.  (If you aren't in CS, you're not doing coursework!)
- **Week 11-12**: Consolidation/revision week for students taking the exam.

## Exam vs coursework unit.
If you're not a CS student, you're doing the exam version of the unit.  If you are a CS student, look on your BB course list.  
- If you see: **COMS30063_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience (with Coursework) 2022** then you're doing coursework.  
- If you see **COMS30016_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience 2022** you're on the exam unit.

Please get in touch with your school office (for CS, coms-info@bristol.ac.uk) if you have any questions about this.  Conor and I don't touch the enrollment process!

You additionally may have a **COMS30017_2022_TB-1: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022**, which is common to everyone.

## QA
The course has two primary routes for QA:
- Synchronous QA in the problem classes in MVB 1.11 on Wednesdays at 10-11am.
- Asynchronous QA on Teams, (as we did during COVID). You should already have been added to the group "Welcome to COMS30017: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022/23 (TB-1, A)". You can download the MS Teams app free [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app), or use their web app (https://teams.microsoft.com/; Chrome seems least buggy...).
