## Links:
- We will run QA on Teams, (as we did during COVID). You should already have been added to the group "Welcome to COMS30017: Computational Neuroscience (Teaching Unit) 2022/23 (TB-1, A)". You can download the MS Teams app free [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app), or use their web app (https://teams.microsoft.com/; Chrome seems least buggy...).
